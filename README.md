
The goal of the project is to prepare a tidy data set that can be used for later analysis.  

The data used are collected from the accelerometers of the Samsung Galaxy SII smartphone. A full description is available here:http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

And here are the data for the project: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

Output of the Project includes:
- a tidy data set 
- Dedicated Github repository 
- CodeBook.md, a file describing the variables used and the transformations acted on the variables 
- Run_Analysis.r contains the r script
- README.md (this file) describes the files and how they connect each other
